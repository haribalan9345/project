                        Design is the 'how' and 'why' people want to use the site; the speed at which the site loads; the interaction between hover, click and touch; and the pace at which you deliver new features and content. All of these concepts comprise design.

                            Well, the life of a programmer is quite dense – most programmers spend much of their time writing code using the computer language and thinking on how to solve problems such as testing and solving for bugs in the code or thinking of how to create a new feature.
                            It doesn't mean at all that other jobs are serene.

                            Just listen to music without vocals, or songs with less attention-grabbing lyrics. Instrumental music such as classical, electro and jazz are perfect for setting the right conditions to get some serious work done.
                            They are also thought to sustain your focus.

                            hey love to have it while programming as it keeps their mind awake and active.
                            Coffee has caffeine which improve mental alertness. So, programmers and their IT professional love to have tea and strong coffee to keep their mind active and working even in late night hours.

                            You can learn to code alone just as you can teach yourself to play violin—but that doesn't mean you'll know how to play in an orchestra. That comes from playing and practising with others.
                            Learning to code with others doesn't just help your learning experience—it helps the outcome.
